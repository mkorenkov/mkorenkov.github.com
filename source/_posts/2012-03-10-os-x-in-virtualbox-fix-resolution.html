<p>There's an easy way to fix resolution of your guest VirtualMachine.</p>
<p>You should execute something like the following command on your host machine:</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>VBoxManage setextradata osx CustomVideoMode1 &quot;1920x1080x32&quot;</pre></div>
</div>

<p>Where "osx" is your virtual machine name and "1920x1080x32" is your target resolution.</p>
